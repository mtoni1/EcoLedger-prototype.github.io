# EcoLedger Business Plan

### Executive Summary
EcoLedger is a digital waste footprint and offset platform that allows individuals and small businesses to track, reduce, and trade their waste impact online. Our mission is to create a transparent, accessible system that transforms waste management into a personal habit, while supporting local recyclers and green services. The platform aims to reduce pollution, create green jobs, and foster circular economies in Kenya and other emerging markets.

## Problem Statement
In Kenya and across Africa, waste management is inefficient, informal, and largely untracked. Individuals and small businesses lack tools to measure their waste footprint or contribute meaningfully to waste reduction. EcoLedger solves this by creating a simple, digital waste ledger that incentivizes behavior change and supports local eco-solutions.

## Solution Overview
EcoLedger provides:
 Waste tracking app for individuals and businesses Local waste offset marketplace Personal waste footprint ledger Reward system for recycling and offset activities
